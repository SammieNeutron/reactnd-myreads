# MyReads Project


This is the first final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this project is to allow a user to categorize books, specifically into three(3) categories (Currently Reading, Read, and Wants to read).

## How to run the project

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* you are all set!


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
